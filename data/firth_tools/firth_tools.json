While a number of methods have been developed for introducing this diversity, the best ways to sample it are not always clear. Here we used simple statistics to analyse completeness and diversity in randomized libraries generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, error-prone polymerase chain reaction (epPCR) and in vitro recombination of highly homologous sequences. For oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, we derive equations to estimate how complete a given library is expected to be and also to predict te size of library required to give a fixed probability of being 100% complete. We describe the statistical bases for computer programs which estimate the number of distinct variants represented in epPCR and shuffled libraries, dubbed PEDEL and DRIVER, respectively. These programs allow the user to calculate (rather than guess) the diversity represented in a given library and also provide empirical guidelines for maximizing this diversity. PEDEL and DRIVER are available at www.bio.cam.ac.uk/-blackburn/stats.html.",

                "abstract": "There are many methods for introducing random mutations into nucleic acid sequences. Previously, we described a suite of programmes for estimating the completeness and diversity of randomized DNA libraries generated by a number of these protocols. Our programmes suggested some empirical guidelines for library design; however, no information was provided regarding library diversity at the protein (rather than DNA) level. We have now updated our web server, enabling analysis of translated libraries constructed by site-saturation mutagenesis and error-prone PCR (epPCR). We introduce GLUE-Including Translation (GLUE-IT), which finds the expected amino acid completeness of libraries in which up to six codons have been independently varied (according to any user-specified randomization scheme). We provide two tools for assisting with experimental design: CodonCalculator, for assessing amino acids corresponding to given randomized codons; and AA-Calculator, for finding degenerate codons that encode user-specified sets of amino acids. We also present PEDEL-AA, which calculates amino acid statistics for libraries generated by epPCR. Input includes the parent sequence, overall mutation rate, library size, indel rates and a nucleotide mutation matrix. Output includes amino acid completeness and diversity statistics, and the number and length distribution of sequences truncated by premature termination codons. The web interfaces are available at http://guinevere.otago.ac.nz/stats.html.",
