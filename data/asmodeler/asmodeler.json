                "abstract": "Alternative splicing is in important mechanism of modulating gene function and expression which greatly expands transcriptome diversity. ASmodeler is a novel web-based utility that finds gene models including alternative splicing events from genomic alignment of mRNA, EST and protein sequences. User-supplied sequences are aligned against the genome map using the BLAT and SIM4 programs. Resulting exon connectivity is analyzed by applying graph-theoretic methods to build all possible gene models including splice variants. The algorithm essentially combines the genome-based sequence clustering and transcript assembly procedures in a coherent fashion. In addition to the user-supplied sequences, UniGene clusters and many well-known gene predictions such as Genscan, Ensembl and Acembly may be included in gene modeling. The current implementation supports human, mouse and rat genomes. ASmodeler is available at http://genome.ewha.ac.kr/ECgene/ASmodeler/. Â© Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.",
