In most prevalent machine-learning-based identification methods; however, either some features are inefficiently represented, or the redundancy between features is not effectively removed. Both problems may weaken the performance of a classifier system and raise its computational complexity. Here, we addressed the above problems and developed a better classifier (RBRIdent) to identify the RNA-binding residues. In an independent benchmark test, RBRIdent achieved an accuracy of 76.79%, Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.3819 and F-measure of 75.58%, remarkably outperforming all prevalent methods. These results suggest the necessity of proper feature description and the essential role of feature selection in this project.
