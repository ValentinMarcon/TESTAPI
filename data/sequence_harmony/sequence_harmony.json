                "abstract": "Multiple sequence alignments are often used to reveal functionally important residues within a protein family. They can be particularly useful for the identification of key residues that determine functional differences between protein subfamilies. We present a new entropy-based method, Sequence Harmony (SH) that accurately detects subfamily-specific positions from a multiple sequence alignment. The SH algorithm implements a novel formula, able to score compositional differences between subfamilies, without imposing conservation, in a simple manner on an intuitive scale. We compare our method with the most important published methods, i.e. AMAS, TreeDet and SDP-pred, using three well-studied protein families: The receptor-binding domain (MH2) of the Smad family of transcription factors, the Ras-superfamily of small GTPases and the MIP-family of integral membrane transporters. We demonstrate that SH accurately selects known functional sites with higher coverage than the other methods for these test-cases. This shows that compositional differences between protein subfamilies provide sufficient basis for identification of functional sites. In addition, SH selects a number of sites of unknown function that could be interesting candidates for further experimental investigation. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",

                "abstract": "Multiple sequence alignments are often used for the identification of key specificity-determining residues within protein families. We present a web server implementation of the Sequence Harmony (SH) method previously introduced. SH accurately detects subfamily specific positions from a multiple alignment by scoring compositional differences between subfamilies, without imposing conservation. The SH web server allows a quick selection of subtype specific sites from a multiple alignment given a subfamily grouping. In addition, it allows the predicted sites to be directly mapped onto a protein structure and displayed. We demonstrate the use of the SH server using the family of plant mitochondrial alternative oxidases (AOX). In addition, we illustrate the usefulness of combining sequence and structural information by showing that the predicted sites are clustered into a few distinct regions in an AOX homology model.
