                "abstract": "The GeneFizz (http://pbga.pasteur.fr/GeneFizz) web tool permits the direct comparison between two types of segmentations for DNA sequences (possibly annotated): the coding/non-coding segmentation associated with genomic annotations (simple genes or exons in split genes) and the physics-based structural segmentation between helix and coil domains (as provided by the classical helix-coil model). There appears to be a varying degree of coincidence for different genomes between the two types of segmentations, from almost perfect to non-relevant. Following these two extremes, GeneFizz can be used for two purposes: ab initio physics-based identification of new genes (as recently shown for Plasmodium falciparum) or the exploration of possible evolutionary signals revealed by the discrepancies observed between the two types of information.",

A Physics-Based Gene Identification (PBGI) method was formulated recently (Yeramian, Gene, 255, 139-150, 151-168, 2000a,b) to address this problem, taking as a model the Plasmodium falciparum genome. Here, the predictive power of this method is put under experimental test for this genome. The presented results demonstrate the usefulness of the PBGI as a gene-identification tool for P. falciparum, notably for the discovery of new genes with no homology to known genes. Perspectives opened by this new method for other eukaryotic genomes are also mentioned.",
